Hey, I'm Mohammed 👋
Computer Scientist × AI Engineer × Builder
I like turning ideas into systems that actually work — whether that's an ML pipeline predicting glucose levels from images, an LLM-powered compliance tool, or a bot screening crypto markets at 3am.
Based in Qatar. First Class Honours in Computer Science from LJMU. Currently exploring the edges of what AI can do.

What I Build
🧠 AI & Machine Learning

Non-invasive glucose monitoring using ML pipelines and medical imaging
Quality compliance checker powered by Gemini API + structured prompt engineering
Facial recognition systems with real-time detection

⚡ Automation & Data

E-commerce scrapers that extract, clean, and structure marketplace data at scale
DEX screening bots integrating wallet APIs and market filters
Backend systems that don't break

🔧 The Stack
Python  ·  Java  ·  SQL  ·  JavaScript  ·  HTML/CSS
LLMs  ·  Gemini API  ·  OpenCV  ·  REST APIs  ·  Git

Currently

🛠️ Building tools that sit at the intersection of AI and real-world utility
